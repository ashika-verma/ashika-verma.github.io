        <h2>Security of CAT-SOOP</h2>
        <p>
          My final project for Network and Computer Security (6.857) was a
          security analysis of a popular MIT learning management system. We
          managed to break into a misconfigured CAT-SOOP instance run by the
          <a href="https://sicp-s1.mit.edu/" target="_blank">6.0001+2</a>, one
          of the largest classes at MIT, and reveal sensitive data as well as
          the ability to shut down the website entirely. Click
          <a href="./files/CAT_SOOP_final_project.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
          to read our final paper, which also received the highest score in the
          class.

        <h2>
          Transformation Tolerance of Machine Based Face Recognition Systems
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a
          <a href="https://superurop.mit.edu/" target="_blank"
            >SuperUROP scholar</a
          >, I worked with
          <a href="http://www.kylekeane.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Keane</a> in
          the
          <a href="https://web.mit.edu/sinhalab/" target="_blank">Sinha lab</a>
          on face recognition systems' abilities to detect faces given various
          levels of hue shift and directly compared the systems' abilities to
          those of humans. I presented a poster for the
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >ICLRWorkshop2021</a
          >, presented a talk on my research at the MIT SuperUROP showcase, and
          wrote a

          to summarize my work.

        <h2>Vocagen</h2>
        <p>
          My final project for Interactive Music Systems (21M.385) was an
          application which generated harmonies based on some user recorded
          audio. I designed the entire user interface as well as the system
          which records and plays back audio. All development was done in Python
          and we used the Kivy library for the graphics. The code is on
          <a

          >
          and a demo video along with some questionable singing can be found

        <h2>XKCD New Tab</h2>
        <p>
          I got bored one day and developed a Chrome extension which shows a
          random XKCD along with its hovertext on every new tab in Chrome. Feel
          free to use it as well and add it to your browser
          <a

        <h2>Routify</h2>
        <p>
          I competed individually in MIT's web.lab competition over IAP and
          created a website which gamifies your productivity and allows you to
          compete against others. I placed fourth overall and learned lots about
          full-stack development. Unfortunately, Google's authentication only
          works for secured websites which I can't quite get on Heruko today,
          but feel free to check out the homepage
          <a href="http://routify.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>! Also
          feel free to check out

          for preview images and code.

        <h2>Club in One (2011)</h2>

        <p>
          I coded for the first time in a local math camp (<a
            href="http://see-math.math.tamu.edu/"
            target="_blank"
            >SEE-Math</a
          >) with the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&M. The goal was to
          make an animation using
          <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com/" target="_blank">Maple</a>, which
          allowed us to draw shapes and translate or rotate the shapes. As an 11
          year old, I had a great time and it was an amazing sneak peak into
          some of the fun things you can do with programming. Take a look at
